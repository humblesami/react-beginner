	Target Audience

Being a beginner to react, I faced losts of difficulty to find/run a simple react tutorial for beginner.
I managed to run my first simple app from https://github.com/arqex/react-router-boilerplate
I simplified it for me and you, excluding the complex things like eslint which I still have to learn.
I am sharing it for you.


	This application contains

1. Simple routing => /home, /about etc
2. nested-routes and views like /topics/components, /topics/props-v-state
3. Ajax request for communication with server
4. Data binding i.e. js to html using setState function
5. Simple css files one for all application and other for home page	


	Coding Guide for making changes (Its incomplete yet) Highlights


Being beginner you only need to interact only with two folders
1. html
2. App

html is a simple folder contains index.html and assets/css folder

In app folder you need to do the most only with main.js (Main file of our react-app) and views folder
Home.js is a simple react component which returns a view

I will keep posting the details of coding
